emphasizes wireless connectivity, VoIP services, and robust security features. The network 
will incorporate various protocols such as RSTP, VLANs, HSRP, EIGRP, DNS, DHCP, NAT/PAT, 
SSH, Wireless LAN Controller, RADIUS (AAA), Port Security, DHCP Snooping, Dynamic ARP 
Inspection, QoS, ACLs and VoIP. Cisco Packet Tracer has been used to design this network.
